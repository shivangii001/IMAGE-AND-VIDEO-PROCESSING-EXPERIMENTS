# Image and Video Processing Experiments

Welcome to the **Image and Video Processing Experiments** repository! This repository contains various experiments related to image and video processing. 
Each experiment is organized into its own directory and includes detailed documentation, input and output files, and code.

## Repository Structure

- **experiment1/**: Contains files for Experiment 1, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.
- **experiment2/**: Contains files for Experiment 2, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.
- **experiment3/**: Contains files for Experiment 3, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.
- **experiment4/**: Contains files for Experiment 4, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.
- **experiment5/**: Contains files for Experiment 5, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.
- **experiment6/**: Contains files for Experiment 6, including README.md, input files, output files, and code.

## Experiments Overview

- **[Experiment 1](experiments/Exp-01)**: (BMP IMAGE)READ, WRITE AND CHANNEL MANIPULATION.
- **[Experiment 2](experiments/EXP-02)**: SCALING AND ROTATION.

- **[Experiment 3](experiments/EXP-03)**: FREQUENCY DOMAIN TRANSFORMATION. Q1. Write your own function for computing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and
inverse FFT of an Image with any random spatial dimension
Input: An Image
Output: Visualization of Magnitude and phase spectrum of that image
Q2. Read the image dip.tiff, and perform the following operation on the image.
1. Multiply the image by (‚àí1)ùë•+ùë¶
2. Compute the FFT
3. Compute the Complex Conjugate of resultant FFT.
4. Compute Inverse FFT (iFFT) of the Complex Conjugate. (Which you
got in step 3.)
5. Multiply the real part of the result by (‚àí1)ùë•+ùë¶
Use the FFT and inverse FFT functions (Your own function) of Q1 for this
experiment
Output: Show the resultant image. Explain the rationality behind
the output.

- **[Experiment 4](experiments/EXP-04)**: SPATIAL FILTERING
- **[Experiment 5](experiments/EXP-05)**: 
- **[Experiment 6](experiments/EXP-06)**: Description and details of Experiment 6.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivangii001/IMAGE-AND-VIDEO-PROCESSING-EXPERIMENTS.git
2. **Navigate to the Experiment Directory:**

    For example, to work on Experiment 1:
    
    ```bash
    cd IMAGE-AND-VIDEO-PROCESSING-EXPERIMENTS/experiment1

3. **Read the Experiment's README.md:**

    Each experiment directory contains a README.md file with specific instructions, descriptions, and details about the experiment. Open this file to understand how to use the files in that directory.

4. **Run the Code:**

    Follow the instructions provided in each experiment's README.md file to run the provided code and analyze the results. This will typically involve setting up any required dependencies, executing scripts or programs, and reviewing the output files.
